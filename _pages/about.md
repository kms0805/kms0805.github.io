<span style="color: #2698ba; font-family: Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 32px;">Hi!ðŸ‘‹</span>

I am M.S/Ph.D. student at the [Machine Intelligence Lab](http://milab.snu.ac.kr) at Seoul National University, advised by Prof. [Kyomin Jung](http://milab.snu.ac.kr/kjung/index.html). My research focuses on Natural Language Processing. 


In this age where AI is rapidly becoming akin to a trusty sidekick, I believe it's paramount that we can rely on it without doubt. It's about making sure that as we develop these advanced systems, they not only understand us but do so in a way that's **unbiased** and **reliable**. My research is fueled by the challenge of reducing biases and ensuring that the knowledge shared by language models isn't just vast, but also trustworthy.
